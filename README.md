This is just a trial project on creating an APA Citation machine to make citation on mass number of websites.
As such, there may be missing information or even errors, so please use with discretion.

This is created to make the lives of students for citing references much easier, especially with the number of references to be cited in reports...

Way to use the script:
You will need to have the following libraries installed:
1. Requests
2. BeautifulSoup

To use this script, in line 10 of python file please fill up the list with string format of the websites to be cited as follows:
webpage = ["www.abc.com", "www.xyz.com"]

And... you are good to go!
